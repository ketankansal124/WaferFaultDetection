# üìÑ‚úè Sensor Fault Detection Project

### **Overview**
The **Sensor Fault Detection Project** focuses on detecting anomalies or faults in sensors used in various industrial applications. Sensors play a critical role in monitoring and controlling processes in industries such as manufacturing, energy, and electronics. Early detection of sensor faults is vital to ensure system reliability and reduce downtime.

In this project, we utilize a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains sensor data from semiconductor wafers used in integrated circuit manufacturing. These wafers undergo multiple microfabrication processes such as doping, etching, and deposition. Ensuring accurate sensor data during these processes is essential to avoid costly production errors.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based fault detection system that identifies faulty sensors in real-time, helping prevent defective products and reducing operational inefficiencies.

### **Dataset**
- The dataset used for this project is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains sensor readings from semiconductor manufacturing processes.
- The data is stored in **MongoDB** for scalable and efficient querying.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The sensor data is cleaned, normalized, and preprocessed to ensure accurate model training.
2. **Model Training**: A supervised machine learning model is trained using historical sensor data, classifying readings as normal or faulty.
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts whether the incoming sensor readings are faulty based on learned patterns.
4. **Alerts**: If a fault is detected, the system generates alerts for immediate action, reducing potential downtimes.

## üìà Results & Performance

The model has been evaluated using common metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: The overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives in the dataset.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

Achieved over **96% accuracy** in identifying faulty sensors from the test dataset.
